                By Colta Ives

                This catalogue accompanies The Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition.

                The spectacular transformation of Paris during the 19th century into a city of tree-lined boulevards and public parks both redesigned the capital and inspired the era's great Impressionist artists. The renewed landscape gave crowded,
                displaced urban dwellers green spaces to enjoy, while suburbanites and country-dwellers began cultivating their own flower gardens. As public engagement with gardening grew, artists increasingly featured flowers and parks in their
                work.

                Public Parks, Private Gardens includes masterworks by artists such as Bonnard, Cassatt, Cézanne, Corot, Daumier, Van Gogh, Manet, Matisse, Monet, and Seurat. Many of these artists were themselves avid gardeners, and they painted parks
                and gardens as the distinctive scenery of contemporary life. Writing from the perspective of both a distinguished art historian and a trained landscape designer, Colta Ives provides new insights not only into these essential works,
                but also into this extraordinarily creative period in France's history.

                Colta Ives is curator emerita in the Department of Drawings and Prints at The Metropolitan Museum of Art." <a href="https://store.metmuseum.org/public-parks-private-gardens-paris-to-provence-80040790" class="m-1">Read more</a></p>

                Foreword by Max Hollein

                Featuring more than 800 artworks from the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, this groundbreaking book—organized by thematic keywords rather than the usual chronological or geographical categories, and drawing upon
                analytics from The Met's online Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History—offers up fresh, unconventional ways of engaging with visual culture. Beyond the wealth of illustration, more than 160 engaging curatorial essays place the works in
                wider contexts, while a fold-out, detachable timeline offers further perspective.

                The Met is one of the most important cultural institutions in the world and hosts more than six million visitors each year, with many millions more accessing its collection online. The Museum's director Max Hollein contributes the
                foreword, while essays are written by the Museum's curatorial staff and other art experts." <a href="https://store.metmuseum.org/art-equals-discovering-infinite-connections-in-art-history-80047004" class="m-1">Read more</a></P>
